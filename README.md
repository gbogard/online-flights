![Online Flights](./capture.png)

This project is a fake flight finder application built to demonstrate the features of Redux Saga. This was built
for a talk called "Redux Saga : side effects and scalability", of which you can find the written transcript on
[my blog](https://guillaumebogard.dev/blog/discover-redux-saga/).

## Setup

To make this project work, you will need the [Mockoon application](https://mockoon.com/), a graphical tool to create
fake APIs. The project contains a `mockoon.json` file containing two environments. Import the file in the application
from the **tools** menu and start both environments.

Then you can install dependencies with `yarn` and start the application `yarn start`.

Of course, the application is far from being perfect, being only support material for the talk.
